# Node_Pokemon_Project



## Some information

I saw in the project that we could choose a subject between food, Pokemons or Street Fighter characters.
Therefore, my project is about Pokemon. 🐱

Of course, I had to create a Mockups to explain what I did : [here] (https://www.figma.com/file/B4c30f1Ih551bmiG3OmTkb/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)
